# A Tewwibwe Cuwse has befawwen this game :3

A Tewwibwe Cuwse is a DLL mod for Cultist Simulator that uwuifies all text in the game. Including mods. Nothing can escape.

~~Note that due to its dependency on The Roost Machine, this mod will only function on the gateofhorn beta branch~~
Update: Cultist Simulator has gone into 'maintenance mode', and therefore beta and stable are the same right now. The Roost Machine, this mod, and all other DLL mods currently work on both branches, and should ('no hard promises', though) stay that way for the foreseeable future. This also means, though, that there's no reason *not* to be on the beta branch, if you weren't already.

## Why isn't this readme uwu'd? This is unacceptable!
