# A Tewwibwe Cuwse has befawwen this game :3

A Tewwibwe Cuwse is a DLL mod for Cultist Simulator that uwuifies all text in the game. Including mods. Nothing can escape.

Note that due to its dependency on The Roost Machine, this mod will only function on the gateofhorn beta branch

## Why isn't this readme uwu'd? This is unacceptable!
